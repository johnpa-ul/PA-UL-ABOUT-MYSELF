                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>I was born in year 2005 in Kabalalahan.  I always had a curious mind and a love for exploring new things. I spent a lot of time outdoors, which sparked my passion for nature and adventure. My family was very supportive, and they encouraged me to pursue my interests, whether that was through sports, reading, or trying out new hobbies. Those early experiences shaped the person I am today, helping me become more open-minded and eager to embrace new challenges..</p>

                <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
                <p>During my teenage years, I was deeply involved in Dancing. I also started discovering more about myself and what I was truly passionate about. It was a time of personal growth, where I learned the importance of balance between school, friendships, and pursuing my dreams. I faced challenges like most teenagers, but they taught me resilience and how to adapt to new situations.</p>
